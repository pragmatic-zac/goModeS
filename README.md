# goModeS

goModeS is a Go library for decoding Mode S messages. You can use it to decode live data in your command line or import it into your application and use however you see fit.

## Usage

Instructions coming soon...

## Work in progress

This package is an active work in progress! Currently, ADS-B messages are supported. 

This application supports connection to a networked RTL-SDR receiver to decode and display messages in the command line. Eventually I would like to add the ability to connect directly to the RTL-SDR receiver itself.
