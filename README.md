# goModeS

goModeS is a Go library for decoding Mode S messages.

## Work in progress

This package is an active work in progress! Currently ADS-B messages are supported. 

I'm actively working on a few small things related to error checking/fixing. Soon after that I intend to make a CLI/TUI to decode and display active flights that are being tracked by a 1090mhz receiver.
